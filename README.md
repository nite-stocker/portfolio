# Portfolio website

This Flask web app is the first step towards showcasing my coding projects. The app uses the Univers portfolio template found at [free-css.com](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page270/univers).

The portfolio app is hosted at [ry4n.pythonanywhere.com](https://ry4n.pythonanywhere.com).
